# Time Series Analysis and Classification of Human Activities
This is an interesting task in machine learning for classification of time series. In this notebook, I will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.
The dataset contains data representing seven types of activities, with each activity's data stored in separate folders. Each folder includes files that have six time series representing different sensors.
The sensors are placed on the body as shown in the figure:
